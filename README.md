# SPHS-shell
## A shell in a shell
This code has been inspired by Stephen Brennan's [Tutorial - Write a Shell in C](https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/) with added functionalities to make it run on a Windows machine. Just compile the C file and enjoy!

Note: The command `zeta` refers to one of my other projects, a text-based editor in C.
